Question 1: After watching the 2 badge videos that go with this assignment, I understood it very well and rarely had to look back at the video. I also added a lot of randomness to my sketch.
I tried using 1 bubble variable at first and putting it 5 times in the draw function, but quickly realised that even with all the randomness, it is still basing the loop off of one specific bubble, so all of them just moved together.
I also like the touch of flashing colors that I added, I didn't really mean to do it intentionally.
