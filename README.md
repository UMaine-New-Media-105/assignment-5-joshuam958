Question 1: After watching the 2 badge videos that go with this assignment, I understood it very well and rarely had to look back at the video. I also added a lot of randomness to my sketch.
I tried using 1 bubble variable at first and putting it 5 times in the draw function, but quickly realised that even with all the randomness, it is still basing the loop off of one specific bubble, so all of them just moved together.
I also like the touch of flashing colors that I added, I didn't really mean to do it intentionally.

Question 2: Having plenty of practice with loops, and a little bit with arrays from last assignment, this was actually quite easy. However at first I didn't understand why i needed a loop in setup, then one in draw as well, but it all makes sense now. This is a easy way to have multiple objects without having hundreds of lines of code.

Question 3: Video really guided me through a lot of this. Once I figured out creating the loop for one class, then the rest were easy. Had problems with getting my fish to flip when it collided with the wall, but it was just a simple push() and pop() fix.
